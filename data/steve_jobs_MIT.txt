good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and when called to the second obaid unexpected presentation by the distinguished speaker series this year we are honored to have with us today Steve Jobs the president and chief executive officer of next computer corporation steve has consistently been one of the computer industries for most entrepreneurs along with partner steve bozniak their influence into the industry was by the traditional entrepreneur route of building computers in a garage such an inauspicious start however so the creation of Apple a formidable challenge to IBM in the personal computer market a true visionary Steve was known an early age for his belief that a PC could be put on every desk and made simple enough for use educationally he had the right credentials to make it big in the computer industry because he dropped out of Reed College a sapper guru the founders original interest and a growing corporate culture diverged both eventually left Apple to establish their entrepreneurial roots in 1985 he founded a new computer company next corporation to design a revolutionary computer computer called the kill target in the hiding workstation market next has found they going tough against and rated competitors such as Sun Microsystems however with 1991 revenues hitting 127 million business has grown substantially with the backing of Ross Perot next shouldn't be short of funds in the future or in a more unlikely scenario a friendly year in the White House the current transfer next computer involved a public offering possibly in the next 14 months we hope to hear today just what a good investment that should be stick has consistently been recognized for his contribution to American largest high-tech industry most recently he was appointed to the President's Export Council last August with a role to advise on government policies and programs that affect trade performance outside Awards if his marriage to Lorraine previously an MBA student at Stanford University and also a sister of one of our classmates Brad Powell the couple met when still gave a similar speech to this afternoon's at Stanford days before the big area earthquake let's hope the history doesn't repeat itself ladies and gentlemen we are extremely grateful for still to given up his time to be with us this afternoon would you please give a warm welcome to our distinguished guest Steve hi I guess we get to spend an hour or so together today and most of the time I wanted to spend just talking about what you want to talk and answering some questions but I thought if you wanted I'd take about 10 minutes or 15 minutes up front and tell you what we're doing it next and why the world might need another computer company is that something you guys think about these things okay I thought I'd tell you about some of our mistakes maybe that would be more useful than we have a lot of scar tissue William there's a really interesting book that was written by a guy named Paul strassman and Paul has one of the more interesting jobs in the planet he's this chief information officer cio a very large organization called the pentagon and they really understand software there I had a conversation with him not too long ago and he said the lesson from the Gulf War was that the best the best software will win the war and so they're trying to do a lot of work in the software area he wrote a book though before he got this job called the business value of computers it's rather thick and it's not a good bedtime reading but you can plow through it and there's some incredible stuff in it and when he asked two questions in particular one was he surveyed a bunch of companies from not very successful all the way up through really successful and there's somebody taking notes here and he asked he asked how much they spent on information technology as a percentage of revenues and he got a very counterintuitive answer right you'd think that either the really successful companies would I would spend more or less than the not successful companies depending on your theory but it was exactly the same they all spent about two percent of revenues on information technology and he found this curious and so he asked another question how do they spend their money and he found out that the the really successful ones actually let's start with the not so successful ones as we success increases and dollars increase he found out that the not so successful ones spent the majority of their money on management productivity and the more successful one has spent the majority of their money on operational productivity applications right now this was not very pleasant for me to read because I spent the first ten years of my life on management productivity which was PCs right PCs and Macs never attacked operational productivity they just attacked management productivity why is that because you can't go down to your local computer store and buy an app that will help you do stock trading or will help you run a hospital or will help you in whatever operational part of your business you want to automate right unless you're a very very small business then you could run some accounting packages but other than that if you were medium size or large business these things never attacked operational productivity so we zoom out and we say how if people attacked operational productivity with information technology well in the 60s they bought a mainframe and they got some terminals and a bunch of COBOL programmers and they wrote a few apps and most of them were kind of backroom apps and it sort of worked for the very few that could afford to do this in the 70s they got a mainframe and some terminals and they did the same thing and a few of them got a few mini computers and terminals and tried to do a little cheaper in the 80s nothing changed mainframe in terminals minis and terminals until maybe about two or three years ago what happened two or three years ago was that the front office started to realize that they needed operational apps so bad that they couldn't depend on on the Mis folks anymore they started taking life into their own hands and working with sometimes working with the Mis folks to start downsizing and getting some servers and running some industry standard databases like Sybase or Oracle in the servers and making a little local area network and getting maybe some Sun workstations and spending about two years writing some mission-critical operational applications like trading apps for Wall Street perfect example and it kind of worked and the reason that they needed to do this was because more and more they were discovering that things like new products required a custom operational application an example if you're in financial services and you come up with a new product it's only three things it's an idea it's a Salesforce and it's a custom app to bang on databases to make the product real to do the mortgage swaps or whatever it is you want to do without the app you don't have a product and so there's been a increasing build-up of demand from the front parts of corporations to create more and more and more of these operational applications and I think it's going to get to the point where this becomes fairly clear that this is the next big revolution in desktop computing is to create these opera to the operational productivity and as we start to re-engineer the way we do things to automate a lot of this in custom applications it sounds a little strange now to most people sounds like desktop publishing did in 1985 nobody knew what it was everybody thought it was kind of a strange vertical thing over there but my guess is it's pretty horizontal and we're attacking vertical markets now that know they want this and it's going extremely well son is the only company that's really had any success at this and we're knocking them out of the box because we came up with the software called next step which lets you build apps five to ten times faster than anything anyone has ever seen and after you build them they're deployable and usable by mere mortals because it's really easy to use this computer and you can interoperate your custom apps seamlessly with a bunch of off-the-shelf productivity apps so we go to these companies that use Suns and take two years to write their apps or thinking about using sense and they can write their apps in about 90 days on the next now if you're on wall street and you can write you can create a new product in ninety days versus your competitor in two years that's eight new products you can field for there every one and you can start to a competitive advantage that can be created this way now we had no idea that we were any good at this when we started next a lot of times you don't know what your competitive advantage is when you launch a new product let me give you a historical example when we created them how many of you guys use Macs good how many of you have seen in Next oh that's how many of you use it next that's not so bad we got to change that ratio we're on the right track anyway we when we started when we did the Macintosh we never anticipated desktop publishing when we created the Mac sounds funny because that turned out to be the Mac's compelling advantage right the thing that it did not one and a half or two times better than everything else but you know four or five times better than anything else where you had to have one we never anticipated it we anticipated bitmap displays and laser printers but we never thought about pagemaker that whole industry really coming down to the desktop maybe we weren't smart enough but we were smart enough to see it start to happen nine to twelve months later and we changed our entire marketing and business strategy to focus on desktop publishing and it became the Trojan horse that eventually got the Mac into corporate America where it could show its owners all the other wonderful things you could do likewise when we created next step this revolutionary object-oriented software that we have our target customer coming from the PC world where shrink-wrap apps were king was Lotus and Adobe in WordPerfect in all the shrink-wrap apps developers and the purpose was to let them create their apps 5 to 10 times faster these shrink-wrapped apps and it worked we have a ton of shrink-wrapped apps now on Best of Breed in almost every category but it wasn't till early and 91 early last year a little over a year ago that some really big companies came to us and said you don't understand what you've got the same software that allows Lotus to create their apps five to ten times is letting us build our in-house mission-critical apps five to ten times faster and this is the biggest problem we've had this is a huge problem for every big company and almost all medium-sized companies and you have the solution in your hands and you dummies don't even know it and it took him about three months before we finally heard and in last summer we changed our whole sales and marketing strategy around to focus on that it's taken off like a rocket and we grew about 4x last year and probably grow about 2x this year and our customer list is is now very very strong and growing like crazy we just got back from spending a few days in DC and in New York and we're talking to customers we only dreamed of talking to a year ago so that's what we do and our archenemies son they want to kill us which is good they should try to do that as soon as possible because the sooner they do it the cheaper it will be for them but they want I think it's gone past the point where it's possible and they can't the greatest thing is hardware's really Hardware churns every 18 months it's pretty impossible to get a sustainable competitive advantage from hardware if you're lucky you can make something one and a half or two times as good as your competitor which probably isn't enough to be quite a competitive advantage and it only lasts for six months but software seems to take a lot longer for people to catch up with I watched Microsoft take eight or nine years to catch up with the Mac and it's arguable whether they've even caught up it takes a long time and we think that the soonest we're going to have a true competitor is probably four to five years so we've got that amount of time to grow ourselves a one to two billion dollar company so that we can compete with them on scale see today we can't compete with them on scale we never have as many salespeople as they do as Sun does we don't have the ad budgets that they do so we've got to have a better product assuming and I hope we always have a better product and I think we can but I'd also like to be able to at least give them a run for their money on scale so we've got the next three to four years to run really fast so that by the time they even get close to having a competitive product we're at a large enough scale to where we can start to compete with them and that's what we're doing with our lives right now spending a lot of time with customers spending a lot of time making next step better and that kind of thing so that's the strategic basis of what we do is that make any sense to you have you run across the concept of sort of operational custom applications at all I mean you guys most of you come from companies where you've had work experience right and you've all done that so if you you have this problem in the companies you've come from of a lot of pressure to write these operational custom applications and hardly anything coming out of the spigot to satisfy this thirst yeah how many of you from Wall Street good good how many of you from manufacturing companies Oh excellent where the rest you from so how many from consulting oh that's bad yeah the mind is too important to waste you should do something the only consultants I've seen that I think are truly useful are the ones that help us sell our computers but other than that no seriously III don't think there's anything inherently evil and consulting I think that I think that without without owning something over an extended period of time like a few years where one has a chance to take responsibility for one's recommendations where one has to see one's recommendations through all action stages and accumulates scar tissue for the mistakes and pick oneself up off the ground and dust oneself off one learns a fraction of what one can what your coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results not owning the implementation I think is is a fraction of the of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get it better and so what what you you do get a broad cut at companies but it's very thin it's like a picture of a why would I could use I'm vegetarian so when you stick it's like a picture of a of a banana it you might get a very accurate picture but it's only two-dimensional and without the experience of actually doing it you never get three-dimensional so you might have a lot of pictures on your walls you can show it off to your friends exam worked in bananas I've worked in peaches I've worked in grapes but you never really taste it and and I think that that you're also a variable expense and in hard times you find yourself you find yourself variable right yes right very good question I'm gonna generalize your question why don't we just become a software company right some very good questions the subtle question we'll try to go through some several things and I'm sorry if I jump around we got a lot of requests from customers last year that they would love to see next step on other platforms and primarily Intel based platforms like the 486 so we decided to do just that and we have ported next step to the 486 and we're finishing it now and it'll ship in the September October time frame and it's exactly the same stuff we run in our own computer and same apps same user interface same training same development environment and we're gonna sell it for 995 and we're going it to a bunch of companies whose names you'll recognize quite easily and are we having it to them a much cheaper price and everybody's coming out of the woodwork to help us we're getting help from Novell we're getting help from all the developers Intel's really helping us and they really want us to succeed why is that right they all want to make sure that there's a choice out there and they're all really scared about Microsoft and they see next step as the only thing on the horizon that can challenge Microsoft and system software for the next several years so we're enjoying a lot of help and you know boy we need it so that's good now we've also had a lot of requests from companies to port next step to other platforms and we're talking to some of those company right now now son we got a lot of requests from son customers to port next step to sons a lot of them are saying look we we may not want to buy many more but we already bought 500 and we only throw em in the bay so can we put your software now because Suns falling behind in software now son says they'd rather stick needles in their eyes than help us do this that's a quote and so we're evaluating right now which will be worse for son if we poured it or if we don't poured it and since we're fairly since we're fairly customer driven we'll probably end up doing what the customers ask us to do because we want to make them happy now this leads one into the question well this leads one of the questions should we just be a software company and we think the answer is no we think we should be a software company and a hardware company in making the decision to put next step on more than our own platforms we clearly decided that we will sell less than a hundred percent of the next step Hardware however we think that the marketplace will grow and we will sell more absolute hardware and secondly the charter of our hardware division is to make the best next step hardware might not be the cheapest might not be this might not be that but we think all in all we can make the best stuff and I would love it nothing better than if some day we only sold 20 or 25% of the next-step hardware but I still think that's a billion dollar plus hardware business and I'll get into one other Hardware related reason in a minute there's some things I can't talk about here but it's in addition to that if you look at how we sell our computers right now we have a sales force in the u.s. of about 130 professionals in the field out selling next computers they spend 90% of their time selling next-step software and then 10% of their time selling the hardware in other words if they can get the customer to buy into next step then they're gonna sell the hardware because right now we have the only hardware it runs on so they are out there selling next step right now and this is what is required to launch a new innovative product the current distribution channels for the computer industry over the last several years have lost their ability to create demand they can fulfill demand but they can't create it if a new product comes out you're lucky if you can find somebody at the computer store to even knows how to demo it right so the more innovative the product is the more revolutionary it is and not just an incremental improvement the more you're stuck because the existing channel is only fulfilling demand matter of fact it's getting so bad that it's getting wiped out because there are more efficient channels to fulfill demand like the telephone and got a real Xpress so we're seeing that that the channel become condensed on its way to I think just televisions so how does one bring innovation to the marketplace we believe the only way we know how to do it right now is with the direct sales force out there in front of customers showing in the products in the environment of their own problems and discussing how those problems can be mated with these solutions a software-only company could never afford to feel the direct sales force with average selling prices of $500 a software package you could never afford 130 professionals in the field with an average selling price of $5,000 you can and that's why I don't think we're gonna see anymore system software companies succeed I don't think it's possible to fund the effort to educate the market about a revolutionary product with a SPS that low and if it's not a revolutionary product I don't think the company can succeed so our strategy has been that we've got to be a hardware company in order to make our software business succeed and we think we can do really well at both of them I know that's a long answer but it's a complex problem - yes uh-huh sure if you ask us who our competitors are we'll say really three things three one is Sun Solaris software the other is Microsoft and the third is talent let's take him in that order son for a while had a software value-added because they had the best Unix in the marketplace but the markets move way beyond that and unfortunately son hasn't so their software's falling further and further behind and we while we take them very seriously we don't think solaris is going to be much competition it's not doesn't have an object in it and and it's pretty much what they have today Microsoft is doing NT which is their sort of second attempt at a UNIX wannabe and that's great and I think it'll be better than the last one which was os/2 but fundamentally it's just an operating system it's better plumbing for Windows it's a good way of thinking of it unfortunately you still stuck with Windows in all of its glory including the worst development environment that's ever been invented and so we don't think that this is really going to present a challenge to what we're going after which are these mission-critical custom apps because the development environment is horrendous it's not object oriented and even with the better plumbing we think it will be widely rejected for what we do in terms of talent talent represents the first true competitor that we could have they're going to ship a product around 1995 if they execute to their plans and I think if they if they do execute to their plans and work really hard by about the mid-90s they'll have roughly what we have today and that that's not meant as a joke it still means we have to run very hard because there they will have a lot of resources at their disposal I think there's a lot of questions as to whether they will ever ship a product I think they're a few years away from having something running unquote but we take them very seriously now they've helped us enormous because they blessed object-oriented programming and right now were the only folks that have it and will be for the next 3-4 years so if we can't compete with talent it's probably because we've shot ourselves in the foot you couldn't ask for something better IBM and Apple saying these guys are right on track and come back in five years and we'll have it too it's great and and so the balls in our Court yes well let's get our terminology straight we look at next step is an operating environment much more than an operating system the UNIX which is our operating system is 10% of next step so in these modern operating environments when you develop a custom app and next step it doesn't run on the Mac or on Windows can't you need all the objects that come with next step to make it work and let me go into a little detail there how many of you are technical here a lot ok great well we've discovered something you don't write code any faster and next step than you do in any other operating and development environment that we know of however to do a particular app on average you write about 20% of the code that you do in any other development environment we know of about 20% of the code then in Sun or anything else so the code that's the fastest to write the code that's the easiest to maintain and the code that never breaks is the code you don't write so that's our strategy right a lot less code and one of the ways that the way we do this is we enable the developer to use a lot of objects that others have written we ship 6 years worth of objects with next step you can create your own objects for your own company and then reuse them around your developers and there's now independent third-party companies not selling system software not selling applications but selling objects there's about it not quite ten of them and it's starting and I think it's going to be very big thing so in order to deliver these apps that are created on next step you have to have next step so they can run on top and take advantage of this rich community of objects and that's why we're porting next step to the 486 that's why you'll see next step running on several hardware platforms and will there be a fracturing if you will sure to some extent there will and I tend to look at it as a trend was there a fracturing when Mac came out yes and there's been more of a transition as people either move to Mac or in the case of Windows adopt what's good about the Mac same things gonna happen here we believe very strongly with the benefits from these object oriented environments not only just rapid development but a much richer user environment if you use an X that's a lot nicer than a Mac or a PC even if you've never developed an app other environments will absorb some of those breakthroughs and more and more people will use next step and things will tend to balance themselves out over time but there will be a transition and our goal is to make sure we're part of it yeah good question if our business strategy says that we do a lot of things well but the tip of our arrow or our Trojan horse which is getting us into these large and medium-sized accounts is our custom application development ability then our growth is going to be paced among other things by the development community available to these companies to develop these apps right now even though we have shrunk the development time down to a fraction of what it was still without developers out there we're not going to win fortunately most companies have really increased the staffs of good people in there is departments dramatically in the last several years last four or five years there's now really bright people who know something about computer science and is departments and most of the industries we talk to whether they're healthcare financial services even law enforcement places like that have on-site developers in there is teams if not they're starting to become a lot of VARs and people out there that we're using in LA or in New York right just was we probably have about ten independent third-party companies helping parts of Wall Street develop things so I think that's not going to be a stumbling block my personal opinion is the number of people in applications development is shrinking it exploded in in the 80s with PCs but now that industry is consolidating its consolidating down to very few companies and there's a lot of excess people out there that I think are starting to get channeled into some of these other areas so so far it hasn't been a problem but if you know if you want to do that please call us and tell us because we always need more so what are you guys all gonna do when you get out of you're gonna go back to your companies is that how many you're gonna go back how many aren't gonna go back what are you gonna do well yeah I think we always have jobs for really smart technical people you know technically based people and you guys are getting a great business education here yeah we'd love to talk to one yeah yes go ahead well these are deep questions I tell you I I've obviously thought about this a lot and I don't want to get into it too much but I will say that that I think everybody lost I think I lost and I wanted to spend my life there I think Apple lost I think customers lost and having said all that so what you go on you know it's not as bad as a lot of things not as bad as you know losing your arm so people go on and companies go on and I think Apple I'm very happy every time Apple ships a Mac makes me very very happy I think the power books are decent products I like them but Apple has been struggling the last few years they've been having a real struggle with who they want to be and and this is nothing new we always had that that was part of what kept Apple alive I think and there were two camps with an apple camp one wanted to be the next serious computer company and camp two wanted to sort of be the Sony of computers and that struggling I think was somewhat tearing Apple apart and fortunately the Sony guys of one they've kind of decided to go be than the Sony of computers and so the power books are pretty good but the quadrazine os-- up win right now the high-end stuff and they're abdicating they're basically not putting a lot of resources on to the power users on desktops and they've put most of their best people now on the portables and on consumer products that they're gonna be coming out with and I think they'll do very well at that now there's a problem in there in that if you look at the consumer products that sell over a million a year you can count them on a few hands right it turns out there's no I mean consumer electronics products not like toothbrushes but but electronics prices and so let's assume they have one of those right or two of those let's say they have a product sells two million a year and at a $500 ASP to them so it sells to the consumer at you know 795 or something like that now that's a hundred that's what a billion dollars right two million a year five hundred bucks apiece it's a billion dollars they still have to get the other seven billion of revenue somewhere so it's going to be an interesting transition as the ASP s get lower the volumes have to get much much higher and you run into some scale issues when you look out at the consumer electronics industry not that it's not possible and I think it'd be really interesting to watch and we also see a lot of that's not quite that clarity of movement but some movement in the windows and in PC world again towards taking what they have now and making it portable but not giving the top third of the market more power you know system seven on the Mac was supposed to be the second coming and it wasn't it turned out to be you know an incremental improvement os/2 was supposed to take us into new dimensions and it turned out to be a complete failure and they're gonna throw another 100 million dollars after it just to make sure you all know about it and so there's a third of those desktops out there that the users and the people that want to deploy more sophisticated apps are there in the desert wanting something to drink and I think there's a tremendous opportunity to give them some solutions now that doesn't mean that Apple is not going to be successful just means they're gonna go off in another direction do what who knows what would have happened you know had had all this not happen so yes up in the corner sure yeah we've done a lot in the last year the most significant things we did were one we hired this guy right here Mike Slade is our VP of Marketing he spent standup and he's cheap too and Mike Mike spent seven or eight years at Microsoft and I originally met him he was the product manager for excel when it first came out and ended up running big pieces of marketing for Microsoft so Mike runs all the marketing it next and Mike came in to next just about the time when we were finally hearing what these big companies were saying about mission-critical custom apps and so we've worked very closely together to redefine the marketing strategy of the company and mike has done just a superb job at that the second big thing we did was about three months ago a little over three months ago we consolidated our hardware design engineering our manufacturing our worldwide distribution and hardware service all into one chunk called the hardware division so from cradle to grave they have Hardware responsibilities and we're in the process of forming the software division right now so that we're all still under the same roof but we have clarity about the fact that we've got to make two businesses successful the third thing that we did was and and we have a really great person running that rich page who's one of the founders of next he's doing a great job running it we hired a new CFO recently Marcel Ghani he's from Intel spent 12 years at Intel doing some pretty interesting jobs he ran all the finance for Europe he ran all of internal audit for the board he ran all of manufacturing planning and scheduling for a while and things like that he's a pretty good guy went to Cyprus for a year and a half and then came to next and he's he's great and then recently in effect about last week I hired a chief operating officer guy named Peter van khylin Berg and Peter is someone I first met when we were looking for an executive vice president the sales and marketing and he turned me down for the job and we subsequently decided not to hire that position and I've been chasing him for the last year and a half almost he's really good he he spent a lot of time at TI has run Europe and about three years ago went company called mercury communications in England they're the mci of the UK and turned that company around to about 2 billion dollars and then was promoted to run half of cable and wire or half of Mercury's parent company Cable and Wireless and was running there about 6 billion dollars and he went there when he thought that communications and computing were gonna kind of come together but never happened and he figured out that his real love is in the computer business he's very very good operationally so that's just happened last week it seems like all the good people I really want to hire it seems to take me a year to hire him and it's always been that way even at Apple some of the best technical people or whoever it always seem to take me like a year to pry them out of HP or wherever and it took me it took me over a year to high mining mike has the award you're about a year and a half and they're all worth it what happens is I usually meet somebody that is really good I think is very very good and you can't get them and then you go try to find other people and you know nobody measures up you know when you meet somebody that good just you always compare them this one person you know you're gonna be settling for second best if you compromise and I've always found it best not to compromise and just keep chipping away so I think we're doing quite a bit feels like we're running a company a lot better now than we ever have we've definitely made our share of mistakes yeah I'll give you a global answer than we need ascend into some details I believe that you can use the concept of Technol technology windows opening you know and then eventually closing but and what I mean by that is enough technology usually from fairly diverse places comes together and makes something that's a quantum leap forward possible and it doesn't come out of nowhere if you poke around the labs and you hang around you know the media lab here at MIT and other places you can kind of get a feel for some of those things and usually they're not quite possible but all of a sudden you start to sense things coming together and the planets lining up to where this is now possible or barely possible and a window opens up and it usually takes around my experience anywhere my life has been it takes around five years to create a commercial product that takes advantage of that technical window opening up sometimes you start before the window is quite open and you can't get through it you push it up and you push it up sometimes just takes a lot of work it took that long you know with the Apple to took that long with the Mac you know took a Lisa along the way one hundred million dollars it takes a why it's a lot expensive to push those windows open its and in our case you know our first product failed we came out with this cube and we sold 10,000 of them why because we weren't quite there yet and we made some mistakes along the way and we had to course-correct you know macintosh was a course correction off the Lisa so with Apple two and three we did it in Reverse but the it takes around five years or some number of years like that to realize that window opening and then it seems to take about another five years to really exploit it in the marketplace and let me give you some examples in from my life Apple two lasted 15 years 15 years the hard work churned but basically it was the same for 15 years dass you know dass just past ten years I don't think anyone would disagree that it's gonna easily last another five right unfortunately and Mac you know Mac is eight years old right no question it's gonna last another four or five years right these things are hard it's not they don't last because it's convenient or even because it's economic they last cuz they're really hot this is hard stuff to do and so when we are pushing that window open I think with our current generation of products we finally got the window open after six years it's open we've got an extremely elegant implementation and we've got five years of work to do to exploit it in the marketplace and when you know will peak in five years five years we'll all sit around say okay it's time to get started on the next thing it's time to get going on the next thing maybe four years from now but we've got a lot of work ahead of us just to move this thing out and educate the market and continue to refine it based on market feedback so everything I know about technology windows that are open or just about open is in next step or we're working on it in the labs and these things generally don't come along independently they kind of clumps of them come together it's been my experience so the things that aren't in there right now that I can talk about there's there's some video stuff that's really interesting that it's going to be integrated in there's some security stuff that's really fascinating that's integrating in but most of the core technologies in their products are getting smaller and portable products are getting much much faster but these things are well known you know the products that we can put on that we can give to you in the next in the next year or two are gonna be running at speeds that I find hard to believe and I've been doing this for a while so I think the windows open and and I think object-oriented technology is the biggest technical breakthrough I have seen since the early 80s with with graphical user interfaces and I think it's bigger actually proved to be bigger over time if you're a software company well the Microsoft's made it easy I'm sorry the question is if you're a software company should you develop apps or shoot you to develop objects and tools and see the software industry with Microsoft and Lotus and we're perfect made it real easy unless you've got 20 or 30 million dollars burning a hole in your pocket so you can go out and hire a few hundred people to develop what it takes to develop one of these polish shrink-wrapped apps on Mac or on Windows then you don't have much of a choice there's not a real opportunity there to assuming you had the best spreadsheet today you could easily spend fifty million dollars marketing it before you'd be breaking even selling it because of just how expensive it is to market a product today right well assume that you have a breakthrough spreadsheet again on mainstream platforms it'll take you 15 million 50 million dollars to just rise above the noise noise level and market it so what the brightest people I know of today are doing is they're writing objects they're writing hunks of things that other developers are going to use to build apps and they're going where where everybody isn't and that's I think gonna be the next new thing yeah I think your question is what is our philosophy on marketing our products to higher education well we started off selling only to higher education which which arguably was a mistake and but we've done really well there in our hearts are there and we sold a lot of Macintosh's there too and we were at Apple and I think it's a no-brainer I think you take your products you discount them as heavily as you can you sell them into higher education higher education is a wonderful place to give you great feedback about how to make your products better and what's wrong with them and it's a great place to educate bright people that you can hire and that your customers can hire when they graduate so we do exactly that we have I think we're sold on about 350 campuses in the United States we are clearly the number one selling work station across the US and we're the number two selling computer of any type at campuses like here MIT or Stanford right behind me a Macintosh we sell more computers at MIT than PCs through the institutional resale engines so we do we do as much as we can and I think it's been pretty effective what do you think right well what's happening is the project the thenis didn't succeed for a reason they didn't succeed because they had a lot of good ideas as a research project but the people necessary to commercialize those things and make them into real products aren't necessarily the same people that are going to pioneer the ideas at a university like MIT and so those projects never quite get baked they the recipes kind of developed and they you make a few samples and it's pretty good but the computer industry is pretty advanced and so other people pick up those ideas and make them into real products and they kind of leave the research projects in the dust if the researchers drop research and start trying to commercialize stuff and I can point to a hundred examples of that in higher education so it's probably good that project Athena has a beginning a middle and an end so that those people don't get stuck trying to do commercial software in an academic environment it's kind of a mismatch as far as we're concerned what what we're doing is there's a lot of labs that are being put in in higher education and we're winning almost every one of those and we really go hard after the lab so that people that can't afford the computers have have public access and most universities now have fairly elaborate campus-wide networks it's not no longer a new cutting-edge thing and we plug right into those so I I think it's life's moved beyond where it was a few years ago where those kind of projects were really important and and the knowledge to do that is exists fairly widespread few more yeah good question I'm not sure I learned this when I was at Apple but I learned it based on the data when I was at Apple and that is I now take a longer-term view on people in other words when I see something not being done right my first reaction isn't to go fix it it's to say we're building a team here and we're gonna do great stuff for the next decade not just the next year and so what do I need to do to help so that the person that's screwing up learns versus how do I fix the problem and that's painful sometimes and my and I still have that first instinct to go fix the problem but that's taking a longer-term view on people it's probably the biggest thing that's changed and then I don't know that's you know maybe the part that's biological but yes management what's our management style how do we resolve conflict I've never believed in the theory that if we're on the same management team and a decision has to be made and I decide in a way that you don't like and I say come on buy into the decision you know buy into it look we're all on the same team you don't agree but buy into it let's go make it happen because what happens is sooner or later you're paying somebody to do what they think is right but then you're trying to get him to do what they think isn't right and it ends sooner or later it outs and you end up having that conflict so I've always felt that the best way is to get everybody in a room and talk it through until you agree now that's not everybody in the company but that's everybody that's really involved in that decision that needs to execute it and so that's how we try to run next the way we run next is we have a team at the top we call the policy team there's eight people mike is on it I'm on it we have six other people on it and the key this we have two things we try to do one is we try to differentiate between the really important decisions and the ones that we don't have to make and the really important ones we work on it till we all agree because we're paying people to tell us what to do there's I don't view that we pay people to do things that's easy to find people to do things what's harder is to find people to tell you what should be done right that's what we look for so we pay people a lot of money and we expect them to tell us what to do and so when you when that's your attitude you shouldn't run off and do things if people don't all feel good about them and and the key to making that work is to realize there's not that many things that any one team really has to decide and we might have 25 really important things we have to decide on a year not a lot so that's that's how we try to run it sometimes it works and sometimes we're still working on it I can't think of once I can't maybe there's once or twice but I I can't even recall a time when I've said dammit I'm the CEO and we're doing it this way you know I can't recall a time when I've said we don't see eye to eye and you're off the team I've had to say that once or twice over a prolonged period of time when a person has not wanted to go in the same direction we've wanted to go in as a team it's my job every once in a while to say hey you want to go this way we want to go this way it's not working so but when people are on the team then we work it out yeah I want to come back to your premium product characterization because our products actually cost you know close to half of what sons do and the reason they do is is we have the most automated Factory in the industry and we have a great VLSI design group which designs stuff in a lot less part do you guys manufacturing do you care about that we should talk about that in a minute the industry is bifurcating right now and what's happening is is that the max and the PCs is you know them today are all gonna be just like this hold up your power book all gonna be just like this only lighter and smaller before very long and they're taking the technology we have today not particularly changing it and getting it off the desktop in portable forms and they're giving up a few things for that but nothing terribly profound however we're getting all sorts of signals from certain parts of the markets that they want things that are the enemy of that right well what are they well speed speed is the enemy of portability because speed takes power so the kind of speed that our customers want it would run for three and a half minutes on batteries that's useless the second thing they want is they want a lot more storage on their disk drives and a lot more memory again the enemy of portability for power and size reasons another thing they want is really high speed networking right the radio lands on these things at best are gonna go nineteen to kill a bits per second our customers want a hundred megabits per second and higher you're not gonna do that with a radio land anytime in the next five years another thing our customers want is our mix is shifted to like 80 percent color and they want true color to do photographs there is no flat panel color display today that will do photographic quality color and they want big ones because once you have multitasking and you can run a bunch of things once you need a bigger window into this electronic world when you're using your computer for two or three hours a day you don't want to be looking you know through blinders this big you want something bigger so these are all the enemy of that today and we're working on smaller products for sure but it's it's really tough to get both and we're optimizing for the power because we see a giant hole there for running these mission-critical custom apps and what people are doing needs more power so that's that's what we're optimizing for let's talk about manufacturing how many of you have a manufacturing background that's great I love manufacturing and what kinds of things what kinds of companies pharmaceuticals any auto people here auto electronics which TI Motorola I heard that remember - no couldn't be further from the truth we we love manufacturing it next and when I was at Apple I had the good fortune to lead the effort to build the Mac Factory and we designed and built and operated that Factory and it was a real breakthrough it was the best factory in the industry - we built the one it next and we made a lot of it we made a lot of mistakes though as an example I remember walking through it you know one of the things you learn when you start building factories is that warehouses are really bad right warehouses are bad because you tend to put things in them and inventory is really bad inventory is really bad because if it's defective you don't find out about it for a while and you don't close the quality feedback loop with a vendor and correct the problem till they've made a zillion of them what you want to do is find a problem the first one that comes in the door and stop them from making more until you fix the problem so warehouse has also cost money because you put all the stuff in them in the stuff you have to go borrow from the bank or use money that could be you know used in a more productive purpose so warehouses are bad and you want to go to JIT J I'm sure you've studied this all and studied the examples I was walking through the Mack factory one day the two biggest pieces of automation we put in we're a giant small parts storage and retrieval system was these totes that ran around and that the second one was this giant burnin system at the end and you know a few tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment and I realized unfortunately too late that both of them are warehouses they're just high tech warehouses right and so when we looked at next we said no warehouses of any kind we have a true JIT Factory stuff comes in and is delivered right to the point of use on the factory floor there is no warehouse deliveries are made daily sometimes more frequently than that there is no outgoing warehouse everything is visible and the reason that we were able to do a lot of what we've done is because we looked at manual I'm gonna example when we were learning about manufacturing in Mac we hired a Stanford Business School professor at the time named Steven wheelwright whoo Harvard's since stolen away I think and he did a neat thing he drew on the board a little chart first time I met him he said you can view all companies from a manufacturing perspective this way you can say there's five stages one two three four five right they all have these things Stage one is companies that view manufacturing as a necessary evil they wish they didn't have to do it but damn it they do and all the way up through stage 5 which is companies that view manufacturing is a competitive opportunity for competitive advantage right we can get better time to market and get new products out faster we get lower cost we get higher quality and in general you know you can sort of put the American flag here with the Japanese way here and that's changing however that's changing and and it's changing as people like you are going into manufacturing companies are starting to realize that we were great at this one time and then we took it for granted and people are starting to pay good salaries now and get good people and so we want to be one of these and we try very hard by the way just going back to software for a minute I often apply the scale to computer companies and how they look at software see I think most computer companies are stage one they wish software had never been invented I put compact in that category and IBM's maybe stage two and things like that and I think there's only there's only calm you know Suns may be sort of in the middle maybe here I think there's only three companies here and that's us Apple and Microsoft in Stage five we start everything with the software and work back but anyway going back to manufacturing we started looking at the factory as a software problem and the first people we hired in the factory were some software engineers we convinced them to move from R&D into software which was not easy we had to give them bonuses we had to cajole them we had to promise them they could come back if they hated it and they went over there and we said this is really just a software problem with interesting i/o devices called robots that's all it is and so we started building the software first and our first robots that we got we Specht them out and we bought them completely turnkey with the robot arms on them and all the electronics and the software to control them and we SPECT it out but we didn't write it and they didn't they worked ok some of them are still in use but they weren't great and being software folks we weren't real happy they weren't they weren't elegant we couldn't do what we wanted with the robots we couldn't tie in a quality information system to them and all this other stuff we wanted so the second generation we Specht out the hardware and had somebody build the hardware for us but we wrote all the software on our own computers we're object-oriented so we started writing robot objects quality objects you know all sorts of objects to control this Factory and we found out our computer was great for it and so our whole Factory now runs on this object-oriented factory and quality system the last generation of our latest generation robots which we've deployed this year we actually built the hardware I've been to Japan maybe a lot of times maybe 3040 times and I loved to her factories over there and I they always amazed me because they built everything themselves they weren't afraid of anything they needed a robot they try to buy one but if they couldn't they'd actually engineer it and build it and you think this was really expensive but we found out it's pretty cheap it's actually cheaper than buying them and so we've actually now designed our inspect out our own robots we don't mill the metal or anything we get that all maybe we put them all together and we do the software top to bottom and we have now some extraordinarily advanced robots in the factory and our computers are built start to finish on the on the key components completely untouched by human hands so we're pretty convinced we're the low-cost producer we do it in Fremont California right under our nose and we export them to Japan and all sorts of other places and Canon is our partner in Japan and they they do very very thorough quality audits and we're now at the point where we're directly shipped to stock with them and they say we're a very high quality supplier so yeah they can well we don't get very permission to do that but yes they can here's how it works um one of the things we do is we actually when we want to build an engineering prototype see what happens in most one of the key things that manufacturing can contribute to competitive advantage is time to market why is that because the way most things work is you design your product here and after you're done you throw it over the wall and you design your manufacturing process here right sorting out a bunch of things that maybe weren't done right here fixing them changing them and then completing the process design what you want to do is do this and ship it right here while your competitors are still here and that's what we've been able to do in many cases what we do is we suck data out of our CAD systems in engineering we zing them around over the local networks over a t1 to Fremont of factories about 15 minutes away and in our own computers we compute all of the robot placement programs fully optimized path we compute all the vision system programs we check it against the Bill of Materials in the is system and we download it to the robots and we're ready to build a board lot size of one in between two production CPU boards on the line full surface mount with all of our automation technology now the key is that manufacturing did that so well for engineering that we haven't built a prototype in engineering for two years we haven't built a wire wrap or any other kind of prototype in engineering for two years everything has been built in the factory now what does that mean what that means is manufacturing gets involved from day one right because the fact that are the engineering guys call it manufacture go hey we want to build a prototype we're gonna need these special parts on the thing take a look at this tell us what you think we'd like to do it tomorrow let us know if that's okay blah blah blah they get involved from day one and what it also means is so we get this parallelism secondly a lot of times when you build prototypes it's not quite the same technology as you're going to use in production and so all the accumulated knowledge you get from building your prototypes you throw away when you change technology to go into production and you start over in that accumulation process because we don't change technology we don't throw anything away we don't waste time and it's led to one of the healthiest relationships between an engineering and manufacturing group I've ever seen in my life they're all working off the same databases they're all working on the same processes they're all working in a very disciplined process environment to where when any processes are changed they all get together and and review the proposals and all buy into it and it's not that hard the the key to it all though was we didn't go out and hire a bunch of manufacturing people we went out and hired engineers and we convinced them that we were going to be different we're gonna pay them exactly the same as metric we paid them a little more at the beginning but we pay them exactly the same as R&D no different there's migration both directions not just from manufacturing into R&D but both directions and they're not second-class citizens they have the same offices they have the same test equipment they have the same computers on their desks and it took us a while to convince him that we were really serious in until for about the first few years we had more PhDs in manufacturing than we did design engineering until design engineering stole a few of them away so it's it's really paid off for us and I think it's one of our real opportunities for competitive advantage yeah I think one or two more and we've got to run and probably you do too yes up there time yeah how are we getting our raw materials you mean like what truck line brings them in or what do you see the key thing is that's not our problem that's our suppliers problem so we agree with our supplier when the stuff is going to arrive on our factory floor and if they can if they're together enough to ship it by truck that's fine if they have to ship it by air that's too bad if they want to have a warehouse next to ours because they're not good enough well then they have to do that now we're not giant so we can't go command people to do things but what's happened is is we have a fairly narrow supply base we we don't have three billion suppliers and they see tremendous advantages in working with us we're pushing our quality information systems back to them as an example Motorola is one of our key supplier almost every key supplier has next computers and we send them statistical quality information sometimes daily daily offer automated quality information systems on their parts and those kinds of things are extremely valuable to them so while we're not we're not Goliath we're a very valuable David to work with and so they really bend over backwards to work with us and we try to push the problems where they belong if it's our problems we take full responsibility for them we own our process but they it's their job to get us zero defect material on time per agreements and our philosophy is our money doesn't break after we give it to them so their part shouldn't break after they'd given us yeah you know I think Macs are gonna continue to grow it depends on what Apple does I think certain segments of the Mac market are going to continue to grow I think certain segments of the Mac market are not going to be be targeted for future growth and nothing Mac's are good computers to do certain things but to do the things that people I think are gonna want to do in a few years I don't think you can do them on a Mac I don't think you can do them on Dawson windows and so I think there's a need for some new technology just like you know there's a lot of things that you could do on Dass when the Mac came out but there was some new things you just couldn't and it would take a long time and I think that the same way with the Mac hey we have to head off into the sunset back to California but thanks for a chance to be with you all for some time
